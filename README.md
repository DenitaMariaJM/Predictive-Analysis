  This project focuses on predicting student academic outcomes—specifically whether a student will pass or fail—using machine learning techniques on the UCI Student Performance dataset. After loading and preprocessing the data in Python using Pandas, a binary target variable pass was created based on final grades (G3 ≥ 10). Exploratory data analysis was performed using Seaborn and Matplotlib, including a heatmap to visualize correlations between input features and the target. Categorical variables were converted into numerical format using one-hot encoding. A Random Forest Classifier from Scikit-learn was then trained on the dataset, and its performance was evaluated using accuracy score, classification report, and a confusion matrix.The confusion matrix visually breaks down the correct and incorrect predictions, indicating where the model may be misclassifying students.The model's accuracy score quantifies how well it predicts pass/fail outcomes, while the classification report offers detailed performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score for both classes.
  
  Finally, feature importance was visualized to identify the top predictors influencing student success. This model and analysis serve as a tool for educators to identify students at risk of failing and to support data-driven intervention strategies.
